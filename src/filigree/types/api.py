    Substring heuristic on the exception message: presence of ``status``,

    transition (409 on the wire); anything else is generic input validation
    (400). Used identically by the MCP, dashboard, and CLI surfaces so the
    same input produces the same code everywhere.

    This heuristic is a bridge until Stage 3 introduces typed raise sites
    (``InvalidTransitionError``, ``AmbiguousTransitionError``) in the data
    layer; once those land, ValueError handlers will catch the typed
    subclass explicitly and this function retires.

    Boundary rule (documented in 2B rebaseline §Task 2b.4):

    - **State-machine sites MUST use this helper.** Currently:
      ``db._batch_with_transition_errors`` (db_issues.py:894),
      ``_handle_update_issue`` / ``_handle_close_issue`` /
      ``_handle_reopen_issue`` (mcp_tools/issues.py), CLI ``update`` /
      ``close`` / ``reopen`` ``--json`` paths (cli_commands/issues.py),
      dashboard PATCH / close / reopen routes
      (dashboard_routes/issues.py). These wrap a ``db.*`` method that
      raises ``ValueError`` for multiple classes of issue: transition
      failure, already-closed, dependency conflict, or validation. The
      helper routes correctly across these.

    - **Input-validation sites MUST hardcode VALIDATION.** Currently:
      ``_safe_path`` / URL parsing (dashboard_routes/common.py), schema
      validation in ``mcp_tools/meta.py``, ``mcp_tools/files.py``,
      ``mcp_tools/scanners.py``, ``mcp_tools/observations.py``. These
      catch ``ValueError`` for one class only (bad input from the
      caller); using the helper would mis-classify future error-message
      additions containing the keyword "status" or "state" (e.g. a
      scanner complaining about a bad "status filter" arg would land
      as INVALID_TRANSITION, which is wrong).

    The enforcement test at ``tests/util/test_classify_value_error_boundary.py``
    greps the input-validation modules listed above for
    ``classify_value_error`` imports and fails if any appear — so
    breaking this rule in a future change trips CI.
