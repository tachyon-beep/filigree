"""Loom-generation response types.

Per ADR-002 §6, loom wraps internal results in the unified envelopes
defined in ``filigree.types.api``. Endpoint-specific response types that
extend those envelopes (e.g. scan-results, which adds a counts sibling
and top-level warnings on top of the batch wrapper) are declared here.

Kept intentionally small: each TypedDict maps 1:1 to a fixture in
``tests/fixtures/contracts/loom/`` and is the single source of truth for
that endpoint's loom wire shape. If a type has no fixture companion, it
does not belong here.
