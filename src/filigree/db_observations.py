"""Mixin for observation (agent scratchpad) operations.

Observations are lightweight, disposable candidates — not issues.
They live in their own table and are promoted to issues or dismissed.

Includes:
- 14-day TTL with piggyback sweep on reads (in savepoint)
- Dismissal audit trail via dismissed_observations table
- Promotion to issue (creates the issue in one transaction, then cleans
  up the observation in a second transaction; if cleanup fails, the
  orphaned observation is swept on TTL expiry)
- Age stats for session context prompting
