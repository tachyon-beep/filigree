"""Entity-association CRUD (ADR-029, Clarion B.7 / WP9-A).

Binds Filigree issues to Clarion entities via opaque string IDs. The
``clarion_entity_id`` carries Clarion's three-segment grammar
(``{plugin_id}:{kind}:{canonical_qualified_name}``, per Clarion's
ADR-003) but Filigree never parses it — the federation enrich-only
rule (``loom.md`` §5) requires that Clarion's entity-ID grammar remain
Clarion's contract with itself. Filigree stores the ID as a string and
hands ``content_hash_at_attach`` back at query time so the consumer
(Clarion's ``issues_for`` MCP tool, lands separately in B.6) can
compute drift.

Three operations form the surface:

- :meth:`EntityAssociationsMixin.add_entity_association` — idempotent
  on ``(issue_id, entity_id)``; re-attach refreshes
  ``content_hash_at_attach`` and ``attached_at`` while preserving the
  original ``attached_by``.
- :meth:`EntityAssociationsMixin.remove_entity_association` — composite
  key, not a surrogate.
- :meth:`EntityAssociationsMixin.list_entity_associations` — returns
  raw rows; drift detection is the consumer's job.
