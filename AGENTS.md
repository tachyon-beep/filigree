1. This project uses UV like millions of other projects. Use uv run rather than trying literally nothing and then saying its broken.

## Filigree Issue Tracker

Use `filigree` for all task tracking in this project. Data lives in `.filigree/`.

Filigree is a component of the Loom federation. The HTTP `loom` generation at `/api/loom/*` is the stable contract; classic at `/api/v1/*` is frozen. See ADR-002.

### If you see a `ForeignDatabaseError`

Filigree refuses to open an ancestor project's database when it detects that
the current directory is inside a git repo with no local `.filigree.conf`.
The error message tells you exactly what to do (usually `filigree init` in
the current project, then restart MCP). Do not work around it by `cd`-ing
upward unless that was the actual intent.

### MCP Tools (Preferred)

When MCP is configured, prefer `mcp__filigree__*` tools over CLI commands — they're
faster and return structured data. Key tools:

- `get_ready` / `get_blocked` — find available work
- `get_issue` / `list_issues` / `search_issues` — read issues
- `create_issue` / `update_issue` / `close_issue` — manage issues
- `start_work` / `start_next_work` — atomically claim and transition to in-progress (the usual way to pick up work in 2.0)
- `claim_issue` / `claim_next` — atomic claim only, no transition (niche; prefer `start_work`)
- `add_comment` / `add_label` — metadata
- `list_labels` / `get_label_taxonomy` — discover labels and reserved namespaces
- `create_plan` / `get_plan` — milestone planning
- `get_stats` / `get_metrics` — project health
- `get_valid_transitions` — workflow navigation
- `observe` / `list_observations` / `dismiss_observation` / `promote_observation` — agent scratchpad
- `trigger_scan` / `trigger_scan_batch` / `get_scan_status` / `preview_scan` / `list_scanners` — automated code scanning
- `get_finding` / `list_findings` / `update_finding` / `batch_update_findings` — scan finding triage
- `promote_finding` / `dismiss_finding` — finding lifecycle (promote to issue or dismiss)

Observations are fire-and-forget notes that expire after 14 days. Use `list_issues --label=from-observation` to find promoted observations.

**Observations are ambient.** While doing other work, use `observe` whenever you
notice something worth noting — a code smell, a potential bug, a missing test, a
design concern. Don't stop what you're doing; just fire off the observation and
carry on. They're ideal for "I don't have time to investigate this right now, but
I want to come back to it." Include `file_path` and `line` when relevant so the
observation is anchored to code. At session end, skim `list_observations` and
either `dismiss_observation` (not worth tracking) or `promote_observation`
(deserves an issue) for anything that's accumulated.

Fall back to CLI (`filigree <command>`) when MCP is unavailable.

### Response shapes (for `--json` and MCP)

Filigree 2.0 unifies response envelopes across MCP and CLI:

- **Batch ops** return `{succeeded: [...], failed: [{id, error, code}, ...], newly_unblocked?: [...]}`. `failed` is always present (empty list if none); `newly_unblocked` is omitted when the op cannot unblock. Pass `response_detail="full"` (MCP) or `--detail=full` (CLI) to get full records back instead of slim summaries.
- **List ops** return `{items: [...], has_more: bool, next_offset?: int}`. `has_more` is always present; `next_offset` appears only when there is a next page.
- **Errors** return `{error: str, code: ErrorCode, details?: dict}` where `code` is one of: `VALIDATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT`, `INVALID_TRANSITION`, `PERMISSION`, `NOT_INITIALIZED`, `IO`, `INVALID_API_URL`, `STOP_FAILED`, `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`, `INTERNAL`.

### Schema-mismatch (warm-but-degraded MCP)

When the installed `filigree` is older than the project's database, the MCP server still launches but every tool call returns an `ErrorResponse` with `code: SCHEMA_MISMATCH` and upgrade guidance. Surface that message to the user — do not retry. The fix is `uv tool install --upgrade filigree` (or whatever installed it).

```

Every short-form CLI command (e.g. `ready`, `labels`, `update`) has a permanent
verb-noun alias matching the MCP tool name (`get-ready`, `list-labels`,
`update-issue`). Both forms are stable — pick whichever reads better.

### File Records & Scan Findings (API)

The dashboard exposes REST endpoints for file tracking and scan result ingestion.
Use `GET /api/files/_schema` for available endpoints and valid field values.

API generations: `loom` (`/api/loom/*`) is the stable 2.0 federation contract;
`classic` (`/api/v1/*`) is frozen but supported. The un-prefixed living surface
(`/api/<endpoint>`) aliases the recommended generation (`loom` as of 2.0). New
emitters should target `loom` or the living surface; `classic` exists for
existing integrations only. See ADR-002 and `docs/federation/contracts.md`.

Key endpoints:
- `GET /api/files/_schema` — Discovery: valid enums, endpoint catalog
- `POST /api/loom/scan-results` (or `/api/scan-results`) — Ingest scan results (loom envelope)
- `POST /api/v1/scan-results` — Same intake, classic frozen response shape
- `GET /api/loom/files` (or `/api/files`) — List tracked files with filtering and sorting
- `GET /api/loom/files/{file_id}` — File detail with associations and findings summary
- `GET /api/loom/files/{file_id}/findings` — Findings for a specific file

### Workflow
1. `filigree ready` to find available work
2. `filigree show <id>` to review details
3. `filigree transitions <id>` to see valid status transitions
4. `filigree start-work <issue-id> --assignee <name>` to atomically claim and transition to in-progress (or `filigree start-next-work --assignee <name>` to skip steps 1–3 and grab the highest-priority ready issue)
5. Do the work, commit code
6. `filigree close <id>` when done

### Session Start
When beginning a new session, run `filigree session-context` to load the project
snapshot (ready work, in-progress items, critical path). This provides the
context needed to pick up where the previous session left off.

### Priority Scale
- P0: Critical (drop everything)
- P1: High (do next)
- P2: Medium (default)
- P3: Low
- P4: Backlog
