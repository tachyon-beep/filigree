# ADR-012: Actor Identity Threat Model

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-05-18
**Deciders**: John (project lead)
**Context**: 2.1.0 hardening pass identified that `actor` strings on every write are unauthenticated. The 2.1.0 release-prep §1.4 pins what we *do* enforce (the length cap) and documents what the actor string is — and is not.

## Summary

The `actor` string carried on every Filigree write is an **identifier**, not an
**authentication credential**. The audit trail records *claims* about who acted,
not *proofs*. Transport-level identity verification (binding a transport to a
proven actor) is a 2.2+ work package, not a 2.1.0 deliverable. 2.1.0 closes the
narrowest hole (overlong / control-char actors making the audit trail unreadable
or feeding a downstream injection) by pinning the length cap at every entry
point: CLI, MCP, and HTTP.

## Context

Filigree exposes three entry points that accept an `actor` string:

| Entry point | Default actor | Sanitisation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| CLI         | `cli`         | `sanitize_actor` at group-level (`cli.py:46`) |
| MCP         | `mcp`         | `_validate_actor` per tool (wraps `sanitize_actor`) |
| HTTP        | `dashboard`   | `_validate_actor` per route (wraps `sanitize_actor`) |

`sanitize_actor` (`src/filigree/validation.py:14`) enforces:

1. Type — must be a string.
2. Control / format characters — rejected before stripping so `"\nbad"` cannot
   smuggle a newline through the audit log.
3. Whitespace — stripped; result must be non-empty.
4. Length — at most 128 characters (`_MAX_ACTOR_LENGTH`).

None of these checks tell us *who* the caller actually is. A caller naming
themselves `alice` cannot be distinguished from a caller naming themselves
`bob`. The CLI runs under the user's shell with no transport. MCP and HTTP
authenticate the *transport* (localhost-only by default for HTTP; stdio for
MCP), but neither carries a verified identity into the actor field of the
audit event.

Reviewers reasonably ask: "if any caller can write any actor name, what is the
audit trail worth?"

## Decision

We adopt an explicit threat model for actor strings in Filigree 2.x:

1. **Actor strings are unauthenticated identifiers.** They tell a future
   reviewer "the caller said it was X". They do not prove it was X.
2. **The audit trail records claims, not proofs.** Events are tamper-evident
   against accidental loss (chain via `event_seq`, see 2.1.0 §0.2) but not
   against a peer who can write arbitrary actor strings.
3. **The trust boundary is the transport, not the actor field.** CLI invocation
   means "this OS user". MCP stdio means "this MCP client process". HTTP on
   localhost means "this loopback peer". Filigree 2.x assumes those boundaries
   are sufficient for its single-tenant, single-machine deployments.
4. **Within that trust model, the length cap, control-char rejection, and
   whitespace handling are still load-bearing.** They prevent a benign caller
   accidentally corrupting the audit trail (overlong values truncated by a
   downstream consumer; control characters breaking log parsers; empty values
   collapsing actor accountability). 2.1.0 §1.4 pins all three guarantees with
   tests at the CLI, MCP, and HTTP entry points.
5. **Transport-bound identity (the "verified actor" enhancement) is a 2.2+
   work package.** It would require: OS-user lookup on CLI invocations; MCP
   peer attribution from the transport; HTTP authentication (sessions, tokens,
   or mTLS) on the dashboard. Each surface needs its own decision and is too
   broad for the 2.1.0 hardening pass. Tracked as a Filigree issue and
   referenced from this ADR.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reviewers reading 2.1.0 audit trails know the rules of the game: the actor
  field is what the caller wrote, sanitised but not verified.
- The length-cap + control-char invariants are pinned at every entry point and
  cannot regress silently.
- The 2.2+ scope for transport-bound identity has a clear starting point
  rather than being implied by ambiguous prose elsewhere.

### Negative

- Agents and operators must continue to use claim metadata, session labels,
  comments, observations, and findings (see [ADR-011](ADR-011-agent-sessions-deferred-beyond-2-0.md))
  as the working coordination model. Actor strings alone do not provide
  durable session identity.
- A malicious caller on the trusted transport can still impersonate any
  actor. Filigree 2.x is not the right tool for adversarial multi-tenant
  deployments.

### Neutral

- This ADR does not change `sanitize_actor`. It documents the existing
  semantics and pins them with tests.
