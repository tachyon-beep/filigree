# Upgrading Filigree

This guide covers version-to-version Filigree upgrades. For Beads import, see
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## Upgrading from 2.0.x to 2.1.0

Filigree 2.1.0 ships database schema `user_version` 17. Databases from the
2.0.x line ship schema 14, so the first 2.1.0 open applies migrations 14 to
17 in place:

| Step | Schema | What changes |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 14 to 15 | v15 | Adds `entity_associations` for issue-to-entity bindings |
| 15 to 16 | v16 | Adds `events.event_seq` and rebuilds the audit-event unique index |
| 16 to 17 | v17 | Adds `file_records.content_hash` and `file_records.registry_backend` |

`FiligreeDB.initialize()` applies pending migrations automatically. For an
operator-controlled upgrade, use `filigree doctor --fix` so the schema step is
visible in the terminal and uses the database declared by `.filigree.conf`.

### Before You Upgrade

1. Stop long-running writers: dashboard processes, server-mode daemons, and MCP
   clients that keep a Filigree connection open.
2. Back up the project database. For the default layout, copy
   `.filigree/filigree.db` plus any `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars after writers
   are stopped. For projects with `.filigree.conf`, back up the configured
   `db` path instead.
3. Upgrade the Filigree executable. Use the command that matches how you
   installed it:

```bash
uv tool upgrade filigree
# or
pip install --upgrade "filigree[all]"
```

When running from a source checkout, sync the checkout and run project commands
through `uv run`.

### In-Place Upgrade Procedure

Run these commands from each project root:

```bash
filigree doctor
filigree doctor --fix
filigree doctor
filigree stats
filigree session-context
```

For source checkouts, prefix the same commands with `uv run`:

```bash
uv run filigree doctor
uv run filigree doctor --fix
uv run filigree doctor
uv run filigree stats
uv run filigree session-context
```

`doctor --fix` is the supported in-place upgrader. It opens the existing
database, applies pending schema migrations, refreshes generated context, and
repairs install metadata where possible. Do not run `filigree init`, edit
`PRAGMA user_version` by hand, or delete and recreate `.filigree/` to upgrade
an existing project.

An automation wrapper should do only the safe orchestration around this built-in
path:

```bash
# Pseudocode for deployment automation
stop_filigree_writers
backup_configured_database
upgrade_filigree_binary_to_2_1_0
filigree doctor --fix
filigree doctor
restart_mcp_or_dashboard_processes
```

If `doctor` reports `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`, the database is newer than the installed
Filigree binary. Upgrade the binary and restart the MCP server or dashboard that
reported the mismatch; do not downgrade the database.

### Breaking API and Workflow Changes

#### Custom Workflow Packs

Custom workflow packs that rely on reopen, release-revert, or forced close must
declare `reverse_transitions`. Missing reverse edges now raise
`InvalidTransitionError`.

```json
{
  "reverse_transitions": [
    {"from": "closed", "to": "open", "enforcement": "soft"}
  ]
}
```

Normal transition suggestions remain forward-only; reverse transitions are for
controlled cleanup paths.

#### HTTP Force Close

HTTP batch-close rejects `force=true` unless the dashboard was started with:

```bash
filigree dashboard --allow-http-force-close
```

Prefer the CLI or MCP force-close path for trusted operator workflows. Only
enable the HTTP flag for deployments that intentionally expose forced bulk close
over the local dashboard API.

#### Corrupt Custom Fields

`update_issue(fields=...)` no longer merges over corrupt `issues.fields` JSON.
If you need to replace a corrupt field bag deliberately, pass
`force_overwrite_corrupt=True` from the Python API. The overwrite emits a
`corrupt_fields_overwritten` event.

#### Audit Event Duplicates

`_record_event` now preserves same-second bursts with `event_seq` and raises
`sqlite3.IntegrityError` for true duplicate rows. Embedders should treat that as
a transaction failure instead of relying on silent deduplication.

#### Internal Transaction Keyword

The internal `_commit=` keyword was removed from `claim_issue` and
`_claim_next_with_prior`. Prefer `start_work` and `start_next_work` for composed
claim-and-transition flows. Low-level embedders that already own the transaction
boundary must use the internal `_skip_begin=True` path.

### After You Upgrade

Restart MCP servers, dashboards, and long-running agent sessions so they load
the 2.1.0 package and schema support. A stale MCP process pinned to schema 16
will keep returning `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` against a schema-17 project database until
it is restarted.
