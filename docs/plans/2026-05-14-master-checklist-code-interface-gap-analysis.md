# Master Checklist Code and Interface Gap Analysis

Date: 2026-05-14

Scope: `docs/plans/2026-05-13-mcp-senior-user-review-master-checklist.md`
checked against the current repository source, tests, and CLI/MCP surfaces.

Method: inspected the MCP tool registry and handlers, DB mixins, CLI command
help, workflow templates, and focused tests. This is a current implementation
analysis, not a new product decision pass.

## Executive Summary

Several checklist items are implemented but still unchecked in the master list.
The high-risk schema/default-behavior gaps called out in this analysis are now
resolved; remaining work is lower-scope P1/P2/P3 polish and documentation
normalization.

The strongest completed areas are schema-mismatch fail-closed behavior,
stale-claim discovery and `release_my_claims`, archived-status hydration,
file-timeline issue events, `get_summary(format="json")`, observation list
filters, stats field normalization, strict unknown MCP parameter rejection,
ADR-007 `report_finding` default side-effect behavior, ADR-008 claim-aware
write defaults, and registry-derived MCP self-discovery metadata.

## Status Key

- Done: the checklist criterion is met by current code and interface evidence.
- Partial: meaningful work landed, but one or more checklist criteria remain.
- Not done: current behavior still contradicts the locked checklist outcome.
- Interface drift: the MCP and CLI surfaces differ materially.

## P1 Findings

| Checklist item | Current status | Evidence | Remaining work |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Strict unknown MCP parameter rejection | Done | `call_tool()` now derives accepted parameter names from each registered tool's `inputSchema.properties` and rejects unknown keys before handler dispatch (`src/filigree/mcp_server.py`). Regression coverage in `tests/mcp/test_boundary_validation.py` verifies single and multiple unknown keys return `ErrorResponse(code=VALIDATION)` naming the tool and bad parameter(s), while unknown tools still return `NOT_FOUND`. | None. |
| Schema-mismatch hard stop and binary diagnostics | Done | MCP degraded mode short-circuits all normal calls except `get_mcp_status` to `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` (`src/filigree/mcp_server.py`). Runtime drift is rechecked on every call. `get_mcp_status_payload()` includes schema versions, `filigree_dir`, and `runtime` diagnostics for the executing Python binary, resolved binary path, entrypoint, module file, package root, venv root, and install context. Regression coverage in `tests/test_schema_mismatch.py::test_mcp_server_warm_degraded_on_v_plus_one` verifies the warm-degraded status payload exposes the runtime block while normal tools fail closed. | None. |
| Observation triage and session cleanup filters | Done for 2.0 scope | MCP/CLI list filters now cover actor, file, source issue, priority, age, sort, and direction (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/observations.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/observations.py`). Schema v13 adds durable `observation_links` snapshots. Core/MCP/CLI expose `link_observation`, `batch_link_observations`, and `promote_observations_to_issue`, with regression coverage in `tests/core/test_observations.py`, `tests/mcp/test_observations.py`, and `tests/cli/test_observations_commands.py`. | Future first-class session/run IDs remain deferred by ADR-011; filter-by-session should be revisited if that model lands. |
| `report_finding` side effects explicit, traceable, slim | Done | MCP and CLI now default to a slim single-finding response. Paired observation creation is explicit opt-in via `create_observation=true` or `--create-observation`; actor attribution is preserved for opted-in observations; linked-observation cleanup still follows finding terminal status or promotion (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/scanners.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/scanners.py`; `src/filigree/db_files.py`). Focused coverage lives in `tests/api/test_scanner_tools.py`, `tests/mcp/test_finding_triage_tools.py`, and `tests/cli/test_scanners_commands.py`. | None. |
| End-of-session cleanup story for mixed scratch work | Done | `release_my_claims` exists with actor, label, label-prefix, dry-run, revert-status, and reason (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`; `uv run filigree release-my-claims --help`). `docs/mcp.md` and `docs/cli.md` now define one end-of-session cleanup recipe spanning live claim release, observation promotion/link/dismissal, finding triage, temporary file-record deletion, scratch issue archiving, and event compaction. The recipe requires a session-unique label, dry-run previews for claim release, default refusal before forced file deletion, and label-scope confirmation before archive. | None. |
| Stale-claim and handoff discovery | Done | `get_stale_claims` selects assigned non-done issues, respects expired claim leases, and can opt into active leases expiring soon via `expires_within_hours` (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`). `release_my_claims` discovers live claims by actor and skips done-category issues (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`). MCP and CLI expose both `get-stale-claims`/`get_stale_claims` and `release-my-claims`/`release_my_claims`. | None. |

## P2 Findings

| Checklist item | Current status | Evidence | Remaining work |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Claim-aware writes hard to misuse | Done | `_check_expected_assignee()` now derives the expected holder from `actor` when `expected_assignee` is omitted and the issue is held (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`). Issue update/close, comments, labels, and batch write paths pass actor/author through, and MCP/API/CLI surfaces classify holder mismatches as `CONFLICT`. Regression coverage in `tests/core/test_workflow_behavior.py` verifies actor defaults, actorless local writes, explicit coordinator overrides, and batch partial conflicts; `tests/mcp/test_tools.py` covers public MCP conflict/override behavior. | None. |
| Live-work search and catch-up filters | Done | Search supports bracket/hyphen literal fallback and `status_category` (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`; `uv run filigree search --help`). MCP `get_changes` and CLI `changes`/`get-changes` support actor, issue, label, type, after-event-id, and heartbeat separation (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/meta.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/planning.py`). CLI heartbeat events are excluded by default and restored with `--include-heartbeats`, matching MCP behavior. Regression coverage in `tests/cli/test_workflow_commands.py` pins actor/type/label filters and heartbeat opt-in. | None. |
| MCP self-discovery and docs generated from live registry | Done | `get_schema` derives `accepted_by_tools` from the live MCP tool registry input schemas (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/workflow.py`). Regression coverage in `tests/mcp/test_tools.py` asserts the schema output exactly matches the registered tool properties for each ID family, and `tests/util/test_module_split.py` checks the `docs/mcp.md` headline tool count against the live registry. | None. |
| ID and relationship naming consistency | Done | Public issue payload emits both `parent_id` and `parent_issue_id` for compatibility (`src/filigree/issue_payloads.py`). Dependency tools use `from_issue_id`/`to_issue_id` (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/planning.py`). MCP, CLI, and API docs now document `issue_id`, `parent_issue_id`, `from_issue_id`, and `to_issue_id` as the public vocabulary, with `parent_id` retained as a full-payload compatibility alias. CLI `create`, `list`/`list-issues`, and `update`/`update-issue` accept `--parent-issue-id` alongside stable `--parent` (`src/filigree/cli_commands/issues.py`), with regression coverage in `tests/cli/test_issue_commands.py`. | None. |
| Common response envelopes and slim paths | Partial | List envelopes are common (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/common.py:101`), batch envelopes are common, stats include canonical and compatibility keys (`src/filigree/db_meta.py:404`). `get_valid_transitions` still returns a bare array (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/workflow.py:335`), and `get_plan` has no `response_detail` or slim mode (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/planning.py:104`). | Normalize remaining bare arrays and verbose full-record defaults where ADR-009 calls for slim/default plus `response_detail`. |
| Workflow-template semantics and soft enforcement | Done | Transition validation, warnings, close reason, reopen cleanup, and start-work behavior have substantial implementation. `release_claim` reverts WIP to an open predecessor (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`), and transition warnings flow through `data_warnings` plus `transition_warning` events. `docs/workflows.md` now defines the runtime semantics contract for known types, initial states, type-aware categories, transition validation, hard/soft enforcement, warning channels, close/reopen targets, close reasons, and claim handoff; MCP/CLI/API docs link back to it. | None. |
| Archive and done-status model | Done | Archived status resolves as done when not declared by active templates (`src/filigree/db_workflow.py`). `archive_closed` selects done-category records only and writes `archived` (`src/filigree/db_events.py`). Stats count archived work under `status_category_counts.done`; stale claims exclude done-category rows; archived blockers do not appear in `blocked_by` and do not keep dependents out of ready. Search remains all-history when unfiltered, while live-work search uses `status_category="open"` and excludes archived rows at the DB layer. | None. |
| Plan editing and plan-read ergonomics | Partial | High-level plan operations exist: `create_plan_from_file`, `add_plan_step`, `retarget_plan_dependency`, `move_plan_step`, `label_plan_tree`, and `label_subtree` (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/planning.py:53`). Plan dependency reference validation rejects ambiguous JSON values (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/planning.py:371`). | `get_plan` still has no slim/full mode; move operations do not appear to warn about surprising dependency carry-forward; no dry-run compaction preview was found. |
| Close, dismiss, and reason semantics | Done | Issue close reasons are folded into `fields.close_reason` and reason-only closes carry the reason on the status-change event for history consumers (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`; `docs/api-reference.md`). MCP and CLI finding dismissal now accept reason metadata and the same constrained status set: `false_positive` default, `fixed`, `unseen_in_latest`, or `acknowledged` (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/files.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/files.py`). Docs define finding terminal statuses (`fixed`, `false_positive`), `dismiss_reason` metadata, `updated_by` attribution, and stale `unseen_in_latest` expiry through `clean-stale-findings` (`docs/cli.md`; `docs/mcp.md`; `docs/file-traceability.md`). Regression coverage verifies CLI custom dismiss status plus reason (`tests/cli/test_files_commands.py`). | None. |
| Hydrate blockers/context for one-call triage | Done | MCP `get_blocked(include_blockers=true)` and CLI `blocked/get-blocked --include-blockers --json` preserve the default slim `blocked_by` ID list and add `blockers[]` slim records with blocker issue ID, title, status, priority, and type (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/planning.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/planning.py`). Regression coverage in `tests/mcp/test_tools.py` and `tests/cli/test_workflow_commands.py` verifies hydrated blocker context. | None. |
| Requirement-type documentation mismatch | Done | Built-in requirements pack still owns `requirement` and `acceptance_criterion`, but default projects need not enable it. MCP create/promote/template type descriptions and CLI create/promote help now say `requirement` is available only when the requirements pack is enabled (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/issues.py`; `src/filigree/mcp_tools/observations.py`; `src/filigree/mcp_tools/workflow.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/issues.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/observations.py`). Regression coverage in `tests/mcp/test_tools.py` verifies live MCP type descriptions name the requirements pack. | None. |
| Actor identity through file/finding write events | Done | Schema v14 stores `created_by`/`updated_by` on file records and scan findings, and `actor` on file associations and file metadata events (`src/filigree/db_schema.py`; `src/filigree/migrations.py`). Core, MCP, and CLI register/update/dismiss/batch-update/promote/report-finding paths now preserve actor identity in public records and timeline events (`src/filigree/db_files.py`; `src/filigree/mcp_tools/files.py`; `src/filigree/cli_commands/files.py`; `src/filigree/mcp_tools/scanners.py`). Regression coverage spans core, MCP report-finding, and CLI finding updates (`tests/core/test_files.py`; `tests/api/test_scanner_tools.py`; `tests/cli/test_files_commands.py`). | None. |
| Annotation handoff validation | Done | `carry_forward_annotation` now validates that the annotation is already linked to `from_target_id` as `must_consider` before inserting the destination link or acknowledgement (`src/filigree/db_annotations.py`). MCP returns a `VALIDATION` envelope when that precondition fails. Regression coverage in `tests/core/test_annotations.py` and `tests/mcp/test_annotations.py` verifies unrelated source issues cannot be acknowledged. | None. |

## P3 Findings

| Checklist item | Current status | Evidence | Remaining work |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Actor/session filters for `archive_closed` | Done by session-label doctrine | MCP/CLI archive supports `label`; MCP also accepts `actor` for history (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/meta.py`; `uv run filigree archive --help`). The CLI/MCP end-of-session cleanup recipe now requires a session-unique label before archive and warns that archive scopes by label, not actor (`docs/cli.md`; `docs/mcp.md`). | None. |
| `get_summary` JSON or human-only | Done | MCP `get_summary(format="json")` returns `{markdown, stats}` (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/meta.py`). The CLI has no `get-summary` command and remains human-output oriented through `session-context`/summary file workflows. | None. |
| Preview stale observations in summary | Done | `generate_summary()` appends stale observation count and oldest age when observation stats are available (`src/filigree/summary.py:300`). Session context also reports stale observations (`src/filigree/hooks.py:156`). | Mark complete if count/oldest-age preview is sufficient; otherwise add sample IDs. |
| Canonical `get_stats` fields and aliases | Done | `get_stats()` returns `status_name_counts`, `status_category_counts`, plus compatibility `by_status` and `by_category` (`src/filigree/db_meta.py`). MCP and CLI docs describe the canonical fields and compatibility aliases (`docs/mcp.md`; `docs/cli.md`), and CLI JSON confirms all four. | None. |
| `add_comment` echo text or structured comment | Done | MCP `add_comment` preserves the full `PublicIssue` plus top-level `comment_id`, and now includes `comment: {comment_id, author, text, created_at}` (`src/filigree/mcp_tools/meta.py`). CLI JSON `add-comment` mirrors that structured comment echo while preserving existing `comment_id` and `issue_id` (`src/filigree/cli_commands/meta.py`). Regression coverage verifies both surfaces (`tests/util/test_type_contracts.py`; `tests/cli/test_issue_commands.py`). | None. |
| `release_claim(if_held=true)` held-by-other behavior | Done | `release_claim` raises if held by another actor in `if_held` mode (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`). API/core/MCP tests assert the conflict behavior. | None. |
| Near-expiry stale claims | Done | `get_stale_claims(expires_within_hours=...)` includes active explicit leases expiring within the requested window while preserving default stale-only behavior (`src/filigree/db_issues.py`). MCP schema and CLI help expose the same parameter, and regression coverage spans core, MCP, and CLI (`tests/core/test_workflow_behavior.py`; `tests/mcp/test_tools.py`; `tests/cli/test_issue_commands.py`). | None. |
| File timelines include issue events | Done | `get_file_timeline` supports `include_issue_events` and `event_type='issue_event'` (`src/filigree/db_files.py:1677`; `uv run filigree get-file-timeline --help`). Tests cover CLI and core behavior (`tests/core/test_files.py:2352`; `tests/cli/test_files_commands.py:382`). | Mark complete. |
| Closed scratch/file immutable history | Done by ADR | Master checklist already marks this complete under ADR-003/ADR-005. | None. |

## Interface Drift Notes

- MCP and CLI `get_changes`/`get-changes` now share actor, issue, label, type,
  cursor, and heartbeat controls.
- MCP exposes `get_summary`; CLI does not expose `get-summary`. This is fine if
  summary JSON is MCP-only by design, but the checklist should say so.
- MCP schemas are all hand-written and permissive. Without unknown-parameter
  rejection, interface docs and runtime behavior can silently diverge.
- The live project does not enable the requirements pack by default, but public
  tool descriptions still mention `requirement` as if it were generally valid.

## Recommended Checklist Updates

Mark as Done after maintainer review:

- P1 stale-claim and handoff discovery, except the P3 near-expiry extension.
- P2 archive/done-status model.
- P3 `get_summary` JSON for MCP.
- P3 stale observation preview in summary.
- P3 `get_stats` canonical fields and compatibility aliases.
- P3 file timeline issue events.

Keep as active gaps:

- Strict unknown MCP parameter rejection. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** dispatcher-level registry-derived validation now rejects unknown keys before handler dispatch.
- Schema-mismatch binary diagnostics. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** `get_mcp_status` includes runtime executable/source diagnostics in every status branch.
- Observation duplicate/link/merge dispositions. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** `observation_links`, `link_observation`, `batch_link_observations`, and `promote_observations_to_issue` landed with CLI/MCP/docs/tests.
- ADR-007 `report_finding` default side effect change. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** paired observation creation is explicit opt-in and default responses remain slim.
- Mixed scratch cleanup documentation/orchestration. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** CLI and MCP docs now provide a single end-of-session cleanup recipe covering claims, observations, findings, file records, scratch issue archive, and compaction.
- ADR-008 actor-as-default claim-aware writes. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** held issue writes default expected holder to actor/author and return `CONFLICT` on mismatch.
- CLI parity for `get_changes` filters. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** CLI `changes`/`get-changes` now support actor, issue, label, type, cursor, and heartbeat controls.
- Registry-generated MCP schema/docs. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** `accepted_by_tools` is derived from live tool schemas and docs count drift is pinned by test.
- ID and relationship naming consistency. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** public docs now define canonical `parent_issue_id`/dependency naming and CLI accepts `--parent-issue-id` aliases.
- Workflow-template semantics. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** `docs/workflows.md` now defines the runtime contract for initial states, categories, transition validation, warnings, close/reopen, and claim handoff.
- Close/dismiss/reason semantics. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** CLI/MCP finding dismissal status/reason handling is aligned and documented with terminal/expiry semantics.
- Remaining response-envelope normalization.
- Plan read slim/full mode and move/dependency warnings.
- Blocker hydration for `get_blocked`. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** MCP and CLI blocked-work queries now support opt-in `blockers[]` context.
- Requirement pack/doc mismatch. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** live MCP/CLI type descriptions now mark `requirement` as requirements-pack scoped.
- File/finding actor attribution beyond observation/issue promotion. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** schema v14 adds file/finding actor fields and file timeline events expose actor attribution.
- Annotation carry-forward source-link validation. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** carry-forward now requires a `must_consider` link to `from_target_id`.
- Archive session/actor filter or explicit session-label doctrine. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** the cleanup recipe requires session-unique labels before archive and documents the label-scoped archive boundary.
- `add_comment` structured comment echo if the response becomes slim. **Resolved 2026-05-14:** MCP and CLI JSON add-comment responses now include a structured `comment` echo.
- Near-expiry claim discovery.
